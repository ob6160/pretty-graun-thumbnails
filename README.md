# pretty-grauniad-thumbnails
Created for the Guardian Fastly Hack day. I aimed to improve the rendering of our social media post sharing thumbnail images. Namely, I wanted to add some details about the article content to the image itself to make it clearer to users what they are clicking on.

[Project link](https://subtly-ancient-mayfly.edgecompute.app/)

---

The project runs on Fastlyâ€™s **Compute@Edge**

Useful commands:
- `fastly compute serve --skip-verification --watch`
- `fastly compute deploy`

It also uses the excellent `image` and `imageproc` libraries for rust to do the image manipulation.

The content is served through the Guardians' CAPI (content api) infra.

## Here's what they look like now:

## And the result of the hack:
